# Research Publication & Social Media Guide

## 1. Where to Upload the Paper (Preprints)
Since this is a new finding, you should publish it as a **Preprint**.

1.  **arXiv.org**: The standard for AI/CS research.
    *   *Pros*: High visibility, "serious" academic cred.
    *   *Cons*: May require an "endorsement" from another user if it's your first submission.
    *   *Category*: `cs.AI` (Artificial Intelligence) or `cs.LG` (Machine Learning).
2.  **Zenodo (CERN)**: excellent for open science.
    *   *Pros*: Instant DOI (Digital Object Identifier), accepts code + pdf together.
    *   *Link*: [zenodo.org](https://zenodo.org)
3.  **ViXra.org**: An alternative if arXiv endorsement is difficult to get.
4.  **GitHub**: Simply compiling the PDF and keeping it in your repository is often enough for a portfolio!

## 2. Twitter / X Strategy

**The Hook**: "Logic is just Geometry with the right Curvature."

### Draft Tweet 1 (The "Scientific Discovery" Angle)
> I just proved that Logic can be "fossilized" into Geometry. 🦕📐
>
> Traditional AI reasoning requires expensive search (A*).
> I trained a connectionist model to embed logical rules into **Hyperbolic Space (Poincaré Ball)**.
>
> Result: Inference becomes simple Greedy Descent (O(1)).
> Euclidean Space: 0% Success ❌
> Hyperbolic Space: 100% Success ✅

### Draft Tweet 2 (The "Dev/Hacker" Angle)
> Built a reasoning engine that runs without search.
>
> By switching from Euclidean to Hyperbolic embeddings, my model learned to navigate logical proof trees using only local gradients. No backtracking needed.
>
> The Hierarchy Mismatch problem = Solved.

*   **Primary**: `#NeuroSymbolic` `#GeometricDeepLearning` `#AI`
*   **Secondary**: `#HyperbolicGeometry` `#MachineLearning` `#Research`
*   **Niche**: `#AutomatedReasoning` `#GraphNeuralNetworks`

## 4. Visuals (Crucial!)
*   Take a screenshot of the **"Success" vs "Failure" logs** from your terminal.
*   Compile the **Distance Histogram** (`distance_histogram.png`) generated by the code.
*   Screenshots of the LaTeX abstract.
