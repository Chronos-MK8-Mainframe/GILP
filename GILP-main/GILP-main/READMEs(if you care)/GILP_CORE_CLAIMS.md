# The Core Claims of GILP

If GILP is to stand as a general alternative paradigm, it must establish this:

**There exist classes of problems where directional geometric reasoning outperforms generic function approximation, even with unlimited data.**

Everything below supports that claim.

## 1. Directional Progress Is Learnable and Reliable
Traditional NNs optimize accuracy, not progress. GILP must prove:
*   There exists a learned metric where each step monotonically reduces task-relevant distance
*   Greedy execution is sound, not just heuristic
*   Failure is detectable (local minima are meaningful, not noise)

*Why this matters:* It replaces search with motion, heuristics with geometry, and gives guarantees where NNs give probabilities.

## 2. Reasoning Can Be Executed Without Recomputing Structure
Traditional NNs recompute everything per input and cannot "compile" structure. GILP must prove:
*   Learned geometry can execute reasoning without reconstructing logic
*   Past structure can be reused indefinitely
*   Inference cost does not grow combinatorially

*This is the meaning of fossilization.*

## 3. Partial Orders Can Be Represented Without Collapse
Most NN embeddings collapse hierarchy, implication, and entailment. GILP must prove:
*   Partial orders remain stable under learning
*   Asymmetry is preserved
*   Non-reversible relations are geometrically enforced

## 4. Failure Is Meaningful, Not Silent
Traditional NNs fail silently. GILP must prove:
*   No-descent states correspond to real logical dead-ends
*   Failure is informative
*   Backtracking is optional, not mandatory

## 5. Composition Preserves Direction
NNs struggle with deep composition. GILP must prove:
*   Composing many steps preserves global direction
*   Errors do not accumulate catastrophically
*   Distance remains meaningful at scale

## 6. Abstraction Does Not Destroy Navigability
GILP must prove:
*   Abstracting nodes does not break the metric
*   Higher-level concepts still form smooth manifolds
*   Collapsing subgraphs preserves descent paths

## 7. Multiple Objectives Can Share One Geometry
GILP must prove:
*   One space can encode multiple goals without interference
*   Goal-switching does not require retraining
*   Distance is conditional, not absolute

## 8. Scaling Laws Exist (Even If Different)
GILP must prove:
*   Performance improves with structural richness
*   Geometry sharpens with experience
*   Adding structure improves execution, not just representation

## 9. Learning Is Stable, Not Brittle
GILP must prove:
*   Small perturbations do not destroy navigation
*   Distances are robust
*   Learning does not produce chaotic landscapes

## 10. It Solves Problems NNs Cannot
GILP must show:
*   Problems where NN accuracy is high but reasoning is wrong
*   Problems where NN confidence is misleading
*   Problems where monotonic progress matters more than similarity

## The Honest Conclusion
GILP does not need to replace function approximation, handle raw perception, or generate fluent language. **If it proves directional, navigable, reusable reasoning, it earns its place.**
